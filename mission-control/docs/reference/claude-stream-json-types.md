# Claude Code stream-json event types

Reference for the events `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose` prints, one JSON object per line.

- Source: type declarations in `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.273` (`sdk.d.ts`), extracted 2026-09-16. The SDK is **not** used by this project; its published types are the authoritative description of the CLI's wire format, which is what Mission Control consumes. CLI in use when the fixtures were recorded: 2.1.270.
- Observed reality is in `fixtures/*.jsonl`, plus the runs of the 2026-09-19 end-to-end audit against CLI 2.1.270, whose shapes are written up in their own section below. Where the declarations and what came down the wire disagree, the wire wins and this file should be updated.
- Doc comments are trimmed to their first 160 characters. `UUID` is a string. `BetaMessage`, `MessageParam`, `BetaUsage`, and `BetaRawMessageStreamEvent` are the Anthropic Messages API types.

## Observations from the recorded fixtures

- Assistant messages arrive **one content block per event**; events of the same model turn share `message.id`. The `usage` on each block-event is the partial usage at stream start (tiny `output_tokens`); authoritative totals arrive in `result.usage` and `result.modelUsage`.
- Content block types seen: `text`, `thinking` (with empty `thinking` text and a `signature`), `tool_use` (with `caller`), and on user events `tool_result` and `text`.
- `assistant` and `user` events carry an ISO `timestamp`; `system` events, `rate_limit_event`, and `tool_progress` do not. Use receive time for those.
- The delegate tool is named **`Agent`** in CLI 2.1.270 (older material says `Task`). Subagent events carry `parent_tool_use_id` = the `Agent` call's `tool_use` id. The subagent's first event is a `user` text message with its prompt. Its own tool calls and results follow with the same parent. Its text blocks appear only with `--forward-subagent-text`. The `Agent` call's `tool_result` arrives on the main thread (`parent_tool_use_id: null`) with `tool_use_result` containing `agentId`, `agentType`, `content`, `prompt`, `resolvedModel`.
- Subagent lifecycle also arrives as `system` events: `task_started`, `task_progress`, `task_updated`, `task_notification`, plus a `tool_progress` event. The observed payloads and what the reducer takes from each are in *Observed in the 2.1.270 end-to-end runs* below.
- `user` events have `tool_use_result` with per-tool structured output. Bash: `stdout`, `stderr`, `interrupted`, `isImage`, `noOutputExpected`, and `bashEditDiff` (files → hunks → lines) when the command edited files. Skill: `success`, `commandName`.
- `assistant` tool_use events also carry `wire_tool_inputs` (the command as actually sent, e.g. with a `cd` prefix) and `wire_ingest_context` (cwd).
- Other events seen: `system/hook_started`, `system/hook_response` (the SessionStart hook output, several KB), `system/thinking_tokens` (frequent while the model thinks), `system/task_summary` (`detail`: a one-line description of current activity), `system/post_turn_summary` (`status_category`, `status_detail`), `system/api_retry`, and top-level `rate_limit_event`.
- The `result` event is **not always the last line**; a `system/task_summary` followed it in every recording. Under API retries the reported `duration_ms` (135 s) diverged from wall-clock time (68 min); measure wall time independently.
- Parallel tool calls appear as consecutive `assistant` tool_use events sharing one `message.id`, followed by their results in order.
- A `--max-turns` overrun yields `result` with `subtype: "error_max_turns"`, `is_error: true`, `errors: ["Reached maximum number of turns (2)"]`, `terminal_reason: "max_turns"`, and still carries cost and usage.

## Observed in the 2.1.270 end-to-end runs (2026-09-19)

Shapes seen on the wire during the end-to-end audit, beyond what the committed fixtures contain. **used** marks the fields Mission Control's reducer reads (`src/core/reducer.ts`); everything else is carried in the stored event and visible in the inspector, but nothing in the view model depends on it. Unhandled event types and `system` subtypes fall through to `ignoredCount` — they are counted, never rendered as a notice.

### A delegation that launches asynchronously

The `Agent` call's `tool_result` comes back in milliseconds and is only a launch acknowledgement. Its text is the harness note "Async agent launched successfully. (This tool result is internal metadata — never quote…)", and `tool_use_result` is:

```json
{ "isAsync": true, "status": "async_launched", "agentId": "…", "description": "Survey this repository",
  "resolvedModel": "claude-…", "prompt": "…the full subagent prompt…" }
```

- **used**: `isAsync` / `status` — either one marks the launch, which keeps the call `pending`, flags the result text internal, and sets `task.async`. `status` is also read by the synchronous path's result merge.
- not used: `agentId`, `description`, `resolvedModel`, `prompt` (the description the card shows comes from `task_started`).

A synchronous delegate result — what the recorded fixtures contain — instead carries `agentId`, `agentType`, `content`, `prompt`, `resolvedModel`, `totalTokens`, `totalToolUseCount`, `totalDurationMs`, and resolves the call directly.

### `system/task_started`

```json
{ "type": "system", "subtype": "task_started", "task_id": "…", "tool_use_id": "toolu_…",
  "description": "Survey this repository", "subagent_type": "Explore", "task_type": "local_agent",
  "is_backgrounded": true, "spawn_depth": 1, "prompt": "…", "uuid": "…", "session_id": "…" }
```

- **used**: `tool_use_id` (or `task_id`) to find the call, `task_id`, `description`, `subagent_type`, `spawn_depth`; the subtype itself forces `task.status = running`.
- not used: `is_backgrounded`, `task_type` (`local_agent` for a subagent; other values exist for workflows and MCP tasks), `prompt`.

### `system/task_progress` (many per task)

```json
{ "type": "system", "subtype": "task_progress", "task_id": "…", "tool_use_id": "toolu_…",
  "description": "List the top-level files", "subagent_type": "Explore",
  "usage": { "total_tokens": 21987, "tool_uses": 18, "duration_ms": 35120 },
  "last_tool_name": "Read" }
```

- **used**: `usage.total_tokens`, `usage.tool_uses`, `usage.duration_ms`, `last_tool_name`, and `description` — which on a progress event is the *current activity*, not the original task, and is kept in `task.activity` so it cannot overwrite the description `task_started` gave. `summary`, when the CLI is configured to produce progress summaries, feeds the same slot as the report.

### `system/task_updated`

```json
{ "type": "system", "subtype": "task_updated", "task_id": "…",
  "patch": { "status": "completed", "end_time": 1758240000000 } }
```

- **used**: `task_id`, `patch.status`, `patch.description`. A terminal `patch.status` closes the call the same way a notification does.
- not used: `patch.end_time` (the reducer stamps completion from receive time, so one clock governs a run), `total_paused_ms`, `is_backgrounded`.

### `system/task_notification` — the terminal event

```json
{ "type": "system", "subtype": "task_notification", "task_id": "…", "tool_use_id": "toolu_…",
  "status": "completed", "summary": "## Repository survey\n\n…the full markdown report…",
  "output_file": "/…/task-….md", "usage": { "total_tokens": …, "tool_uses": …, "duration_ms": … } }
```

- **used**: `tool_use_id` / `task_id`, `status` (`completed` | `failed` | `stopped` — the card's final status), `summary` (the report the card renders), and the `usage` totals.
- not used: `output_file`, `reason`, `resource_links`.

### The interrupt sequence on SIGINT

Two lines, in this order, then exit 0:

```json
{ "type": "user", "parent_tool_use_id": null,
  "message": { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "[Request interrupted by user]" }] } }
{ "type": "result", "subtype": "error_during_execution", "is_error": true,
  "errors": ["[ede_diagnostic] result_type=user last_content_type=n/a stop_reason=tool_use"],
  "total_cost_usd": 0.24, "duration_ms": 24000, "num_turns": 15, "usage": { … } }
```

- **used**: the exact text `[Request interrupted by user]` becomes the muted "Stopped by you" notice instead of a user-message fold; the result's numbers and usage are kept as for any result; its `errors` are filtered of `[ede_diagnostic]` strings, which are internal diagnostics and never an operator-facing error. A run the operator stopped ends with no error at all.
- The interrupted result is what makes cancel worth doing at all: the numbers survive the stop.

### `rate_limit_event` (top level, not a `system` subtype)

```json
{ "type": "rate_limit_event", "rate_limit_info": { "status": "allowed", "rateLimitType": "five_hour",
  "utilization": 0.42, "resetsAt": 1758240000 } }
```

- **used**: `rate_limit_info.status`, `.rateLimitType`, `.utilization`, `.resetsAt`.
- not used: the overage fields (`overageStatus`, `isUsingOverage`, `overageResetsAt`, …).

### `system/commands_changed`

```json
{ "type": "system", "subtype": "commands_changed", "commands": [ … ] }
```

Emitted a couple of times per run as the CLI's slash-command set settles. Nothing in the view model uses it; it lands in `ignoredCount`. Listed here because it was new in these runs, alongside the other subtypes the audit saw: `task_summary`, `post_turn_summary`, `thinking_tokens`, `hook_started`, `hook_response`.
