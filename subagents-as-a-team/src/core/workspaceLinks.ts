/**
 * Where a link inside an agent's own markdown points.
 *
 * A handoff package is only a package if its index works: `HANDOFF.md` saying
 * `[Plumbing](proposals/plumbing.md)` has to open that proposal. Rendered naively, that href is a
 * *relative URL* and the browser resolves it against whatever page is showing the markdown — so
 * clicking it navigated the app to `/lanes/proposals/plumbing.md` and produced a 404. The
 * same is true of the parent's final response, which routinely names the files it just wrote.
 *
 * So every href is classified before it is rendered, by this function, in one place:
 *
 * - `external` — it has a scheme or is protocol-relative. An official source the research cited is
 *   exactly that, and it must keep working unchanged.
 * - `workspace` — it resolves to a path inside this session's own directory. That is a file the
 *   console can open, and the caller turns it into one.
 * - `other` — an in-document anchor, or something that leaves the workspace. Rendered as the plain
 *   link it is, and never given workspace powers.
 *
 * Pure and path-only: deciding a link points inside the workspace is not the same as being allowed
 * to read it. The server re-checks every path it is asked for, resolving symlinks, in
 * `resolveInWorkspace`.
