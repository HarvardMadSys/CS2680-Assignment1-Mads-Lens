/**
 * Reading what an agent produced, without turning the console into a file server.
 *
 * A session's value is its output — a plan, a set of briefs, a drawing — and a printed file name is
 * not access to it. So this module exists to let the operator open those files. Everything it does
 * is bounded by one rule, enforced in one place (`resolveInWorkspace`): the only readable bytes are
 * the ones inside *this lane's own working directory*, as the filesystem resolves it.
 *
 * "As the filesystem resolves it" is the part that matters. Rejecting `..` in the request is not
 * enough on its own, because the agent can create a symlink inside its own workspace pointing at
 * anything the server user can read, and `resolve()` would happily hand back a path under the root
 * that `open()` then follows straight out of it. Every path is therefore `realpath`-ed and the
 * containment check is made against the real root, which collapses both traversal and symlink
 * escape into the same test. Both are covered by tests.

 * and a preview whose controls are dead is a misleading preview. The threat is that it runs *as
 * the app itself*: same-origin it could read this console's pages and drive its endpoints with the
 * operator's own session. So the document is given scripts and denied an origin.
 *
 * - `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts` puts the response in an **opaque** origin —
 *   never `allow-same-origin` — where its own scripts run but can reach nothing of ours. Forms,
 *   popups, pointer lock and top-level navigation stay off because they are simply not granted.
 * - `default-src 'none'` with `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` means a *self-contained* document works
 *   and a page that tries to pull in remote code or call home does not: no `connect-src`, no remote
 *   `script-src`, no external images or fonts beyond `data:`.
 * - `form-action 'none'` and `frame-ancestors 'self'` close the last two ways markup could send data
 *   somewhere or be embedded by something else.
 * - `nosniff` holds the content type to the allowlist above.
 * - The caller frames it with the matching `sandbox` attribute (`previewSandbox`), so neither layer
 *   is load-bearing on its own.
 *
 * Files the console does not render are served as a download instead, which is the safe way to hand
 * over bytes it will not interpret.
