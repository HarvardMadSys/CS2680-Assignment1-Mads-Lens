 * and flip a switch before the agent can look something up is doing the console's job for it. The
 * flag is stated rather than omitted for the same reason it always was: `--chrome` can also be
 * enabled globally in the operator's own Claude Code settings, so omitting it means "inherit this
 * machine's configuration", which is not something the console could then report honestly.
 *
 * What this does *not* claim is that a browser is there. The extension may be uninstalled, Chrome
 * may be shut, the CLI may be signed out. The run's own `system/init` says whether the browser
 * tools loaded and its trajectory says whether any call worked (`deriveBrowserView`); ordinary
 * non-browser work is unaffected either way, because a tool the model never calls costs nothing.
 *
 * One related constraint: `sanitizeEnv` drops `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and friends, and the Chrome
 * integration requires an OAuth login — an API-key session has it disabled even with `--chrome`.
